# TUTORIAL FOR DAY1, 18.03.2019



INITIALLY TUTOR EXPLAINED THERE ARE TWO EQUIPMENT ROOMS
1. NOISY AND MESHY (BECAUSE LOTS OF WOOD CUTTING, DUST COLLECTOR WITH MOTOR GENERATING HUGE NOISE)
2. CLEAN ROOM (NO DUST GENERATION)

## THEORY

1. WE STUDIED ABOUT VINYLE CUTTER MACHINE. 

A. HOW TO FIX THE CUTTING BIT IN THE VINYLE SPINDLE.
B. HOW TO LOAD THE VINYLE ROLL ETC.

2. LASER CUTTER (CO2 LASER)
A. LASER CUTTER CAN CUT NATURAL MATERIALS, WOOD LEATHER 
B.AFTER BURNING WE HAVE TO WAIT MINIMUM ONE MINUTE TO PURIFY THE SMOKE/FUME BY THE PURIFIER WHICH CONTAINS 3 LAYERS OF FILTERS
a. FILTER FOR BIG PARTICLES (PRE FILTER BAGS)
b. FILTER FOR MEDIUM PARTICLES (HEPA FILTER)
c. FILTER FOR SMALL PARTICLES (CARBON FILTER, CHEMICAL FILTER)

3. MILLING MACHINE (MINI CNC)

FABRICATION OF SMALL DEVICES AND PCB THEN SOLDERING


4. ELECTRONICS FOR TESTING THE DEVICES (OSCILLOSCOPE, PULSE GENERATOR ETC.)

5. 3D PRINTER (FUSE DEPOSITION MATERIAL) SINDOH, PRINTING 1.75 MM TO 0.4 MM

BUILD PLATE, CARTRIDGE, FILAMENT OF DIFFERENT COLORS

6. 2D PRINTERS

7. CNC (SHOPBOT)

THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE AS GIVEN BELOW

1. POWER ON THE CONTROLLER FIRST
2. SWITCH ON THE CONTROLLER AND SET THE ORIGIN ZERO USING THE ZERO PLATE AND ALIGATOR 
3. PRESS THE RESET SWITCH TO START THE MACHINE TO MOVE
4. BEFORE STARTING THE PROJECT IT IS MANDATORY TO FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES LIKE PUTTING THE EAR 


6. SAW

a. Scroll Saw (For cutting woods)

b. Bann Saw

c. Object Water Jet

# tutorial for day1, 18.03.2019


initially tutor explained there are two equipment rooms
1. noisy and meshy (because lots of wood cutting, dust collector with motor generating huge noise)
2. clean room (no dust generation)

## theory

1. we studied about vinyle cutter machine. 

a. how to fix the cutting bit in the vinyle spindle.
b. how to load the vinyle roll etc.

2. laser cutter (co2 laser)
a. laser cutter can cut natural materials, wood leather 
b.after burning we have to wait minimum one minute to purify the smoke/fume by the purifier which contains 3 layers of filters
a. filter for big particles (pre filter bags)
b. filter for medium particles (hepa filter)
c. filter for small particles (carbon filter, chemical filter)

3. milling machine (mini cnc)

fabrication of small devices and pcb then soldering

4. electronics for testing the devices (oscilloscope, pulse generator etc.)

5. 3d printer (fuse deposition material) sindoh, printing 1.75 mm to 0.4 mm

build plate, cartridge, filament of different colors

6. 2d printers

7. cnc (shopbot)

the instructions are as given below

1. power on the controller first
2. switch on the controller and set the origin zero using the zero plate and aligator 
3. press the reset switch to start the machine to move
4. before starting the project it is mandatory to follow the procedures like putting the ear 

6. saw

a. scroll saw (for cutting woods)

b. bann saw

c. object water jet
